======================
Setting up a LAN match
======================
All players must download and install LibreQuake with the FTEQW engine as per the installation section of the readme file. (This guide assumes all players are using FTEQW for their engine.) All players must be connected to the same WiFi network, preferably using a wired ethernet connection.

If you are the host, go to the main menu and then go to "Online -> Start Game". Then set the game settings. Recommended settings for first time play are:

Deathmatch:		Deathmatch 3
Time Limit:		10 Minutes
Frag Limit:		10 Frags
Map:			lqdm1
Leave the other settings alone.

Then press "Start Game".

Once you're in the server, you'll need to share your local IP Address with the other players. Open your operating system's terminal. (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on MacOS, etc.) Type "ipconfig". This will bring up a list of IP Addresses for your computer. Find the one called "IPv4 Address". It will usually look something like "192.168.0.22".

To connect to the server, each other player will need to open the console and type "connect", followed by your local IP Address. For example, "connect 192.168.0.22". (Open the console either by pressing Esc on the main menu or by pressing ~ while in game.)

Once everyone is in the server, each player can go to the "Online -> Setup" menu to set their player name, team name (if you have teamplay enabled), and player color.

Once everyone is ready, you can enter the "restart" command in console to begin the match! Have fun!


======================

Map List
========
LibreQuake comes with 13 deathmatch maps. You can change the map using the "changelevel" console command.

changelevel lqdm1	Solstice: A small winter castle with a simple layout. This is a good map to start on.
changelevel lqdm2	Hyperborea: A white temple with jump pads. Great for large free-for-alls.
changelevel lqdm3	Torture Pit: An acid-flooded dungeon with only lower-tier weapons.
changelevel lqdm4	Psychofuge: An ancient lava fortress. The dangerous lava-filled underbelly contains some of the best items.
changelevel lqdm5	Transport Tubes: An industrial facility with locking air tunnels that carry you around the map.
changelevel lqdm6	Ghost Quarter: A castle where new weapons and armor types unlock every 40 seconds.
changelevel lqdm7	Boomstick Basement: Claustrophobic corridors with a labyrinthine structure.
changelevel lqdm8	Alichar Sector: A tall laboratory with a long elevator to reach the Red Armor.
changelevel lqdm9	Outlands: An abandoned temple base. Use the grenade launcher to unlock secret doorways.
changelevel lqdm10	Lucifer's Gambit: An evil temple with Lucifer's Protection as the main powerup.
changelevel lqdm11	The Wicked Night: A medium-sized computer station built around a central nexus.
changelevel lqdm12	Javelin: An ancient temple which contains a respawning key you can use to permanently unlock new rooms and powerups.
changelevel lqdm13	Death Provides No Return: A void fortress with jump pads and toggling windows.

Additionally, all of the singleplayer levels are compatible with deathmatch. These maps are great if you have a player count of five or above since the gameplay spaces are much larger. If you want to switch to the third map in Episode 1, you would use the command "changelevel e1m3".


================
Deathmatch Modes
================
To change the deathmatch mode, use the "deathmatch" command. LibreQuake has five different deathmatch modes which change the way the game plays. Deathmatch 3 is the recommended default mode.

deathmatch 1	Items and weapons respawn. Mostly used for 4v4 team deathmatch.
deathmatch 2	Items never respawn; weapons respawn instantly. This mode is rarely used.
deathmatch 3	Items respawn; weapons respawn instantly. Great for free-for-all and team deathmatch.
deathmatch 4	Spawn with all weapons, full health and armor, and infinite ammo. Collect backpacks for bonus health.
deathmatch 5	Spawn with all weapons, full health and armor, and some ammo.


==============
Teamplay Modes
==============
To enable teamplay, use the "teamplay" command. There are four different teamplay modes:

teamplay 0	Disables teamplay.
teamplay 1	Players cannot damage themselves or teammates.
teamplay 2	Players can damage themselves and teammates.
teamplay 3	Players can damage themselves but not teammates.

Each player will need to join a team. They can do this in the "Online -> Setup" menu or by using the command "setinfo team MY_TEAM_NAME"

To make it easier to tell teams apart, you might also want to have teams choose a color. The easiest way to do this quickly is to have each team pick one of the colors below and set their color to that using the "color" command.

color 0		White
color 2		Light Blue
color 4		Red
color 5		Orange
color 6		Yellow
color 7		Salmon
color 9		Pink
color 11	Teal
color 13	Blue


===============
Server Infokeys
===============
Infokeys allow you to further customize the game settings. Change an infokey using the serverinfo command. For example, "serverinfo have_axe_only 1" would enable the setting "have_axe_only". "serverinfo have_axe_only 0" would disable it. After you change a setting you may need to restart the match for it to take effect.

Here is the list of supported infokeys:
